## Brief description

We developed this application for the NTTDATA Hackathon in Chile. We aim to address the two challenges of improving patient registration/communication and reducing waiting times, particularly through the intelligent and interoperable use of medical records.

### What is the problem?

1) Legally, patients own their medical records, but in practice, they don't have their records readily available.
2) Lack of treatment continuity.
3) Inefficient care, as systems often don't allow quick access to medical records, resulting in wasted time during consultations.
4) Poor communication between doctors and patients, with symptoms getting lost between visits. Often, informal means like WhatsApp are used for communication, leading to information loss and potential issues.
5) Patients often struggle to remember the names of their medications, diseases, allergies, etc.

### How can technology help?

By empowering patients and giving them practical access to their own medical records. Improving interoperability between different entities by exchanging data through HL7 and Snomed.

### The idea

An interoperable application that is user-friendly and contributes to tasks such as patient registration and doctor-patient communication. The patient owns their medical record.
